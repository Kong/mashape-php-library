# Mashape PHP library v0.8 **[DEPRECATED]**

The Mashape PHP Library is:
* it's a dead simple PHP framework for generating RESTful APIs
* it supports everything from custom routes to custom errors, following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle: reuse your existing code
* it's fully integrated with Mashape: distribute your components, get traction and make money!
